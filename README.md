# StudyHelper

### Tech: .NET (C#, WPF, EFC+SQLite), MVVM architecture


Simple study helper application. The desired result is to implement pomodoro timer with custom config (saveable), todo list to organize workflow and some mood analysis tool, so I can monitor my attitude while working. Also, the point of creating such an application is that I can choose any theme I want, and I want a Berserk themed application :)

To check on the current state of the application, go see <a href="https://github.com/Aenvis/Study-helper/tree/Dev">dev branch</a>
